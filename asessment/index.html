    <h1>MY VACATION ZANZIBAR</h1>
    <p>I love zanzibar because it is known for its rich history and culture.You can explore the narrow streets of Stone Town,visit the iconic House of Wonders and indulge in the vibrant local markets.Plus,trying some delicious Swahili cuisine while you're there.
        It is also famous for its stunning beaches and the perfect serene environment you can ever think of.

    <p>H1 to H5 are heading tags used in HTML to structure web content. They differ in terms of their semantic meanings and hierarchical importance. H1 represents the main heading of a page, while H2 to H5 represent subheadings of decreasing importance. Each heading tag provides context and helps organize the content for better readability and accessibility.</p>
<ul>
    <li>H1 is used to represent the main heading of a webpage. It's typically the most important heading on the page and helps users understand the main topic or purpose of the content. </li>
